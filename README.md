**LinkedIn Message Drafter
AI-powered tool to craft professional LinkedIn outreach messages for recruiters.**

üí° About the Project
This is a web application designed to help you write personalized and effective LinkedIn messages to recruiters. Instead of sending a generic message, this tool uses a large language model to draft a message that highlights your relevant skills and experience based on your resume and the specific job description you're applying for.

The application allows you to:

Input your personal details (name, current company).

Provide information about the target role and recruiter.

Paste your resume and the job description.

Or, use the built-in scraper to automatically extract job details from a URL.

This makes the process of sending personalized outreach messages fast and efficient, increasing your chances of getting a response.

‚ú® Key Features
Personalized Messaging: Generates a unique message by analyzing your resume against a specific job description.

Job Details Scraper: Automatically extracts job descriptions from popular job sites like LinkedIn and Indeed by simply providing the URL.

Secure API Handling: Uses environment variables to securely handle API keys, ensuring they are not exposed in the source code.

Clean and Modern UI: A simple, intuitive interface built with React that is easy to navigate.
